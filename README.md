Participation   (team contributions)   is 5%   per   project and will   be   reviewed and   assessed   by facilitators   during   project workshops from the following two aspects:
•         Students   will be assessed based on the quality   and insightfulness    of   their    pre-submitted   discussion points. These   points should demonstrate thorough preparation and a solid   understanding of the task   performed   and the   project.   If you do   not   have   a   specific   discussion   point   for   the   session,   you   are   expected   to   provide   a   brief   summary   of   your   recent   project   work,   including an explanation of   how this work   contributes to   the   team’s   efforts.
•          During   the   workshop,   students   are   also   evaluated   based   on   how   actively   they   engage   with   the discussion and facilitate a collaborative   and   enriching   learning   atmosphere.

3 Based   on the   categories   outlined   in the   rubric,   students will   be   awarded   0,   1,   2,   or   3   points   for their   participation   in each   relevant   meeting. These   points will   be accumulated over   the   designated   weeks   and   then   scaled   to   an   overall   mark   out   of   5   points   for   project   participation.   It   is   important   to   note   that   merely   submitting   a   discussion   point   does   not   contribute   directly   to   the   participation   score.   Active   attendance   and   engagement   in   class   discussions   are   necessary   for   your   participation   to   be   evaluated and   scored.
Some things you can do to   benefit your team   and   aid   in your   assessment   when   working   with   facilitators are:
•             Ensuring that you are   an   active   contributor
•            Asking   insightful questions
•             Encouraging   participation   by others
•             Summing   up   key discussion   points as appropriate
